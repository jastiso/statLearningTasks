        The amount of time the experiment takes is not fixed, but the number of responses you have to make is. Therefore, you should make your responses both quickly and accurately.
        The 20 minute estimate is based on previous data, and may take shorter or longer for you.
        </p>
        <p>
        Please try your best to pay attention to the experiment. Your contribution will be much more helpful for us (thanks, really!), and you will be able to complete the experiment more quickly as well.
        </p>
        <p>
        This task will take place in four blocks. At the end of each block, you will get points based on how quickly you responded to key presses. You will also see your accuracy for that block. Try to answer quickly and accurately to get more points. 
        </p>
        <p>
        If you make a mistake, a message will display on the screen and the trial will be counted as incorrect, but the same square will remain lit until you press the correct key.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, if you wait more than one minute to make any individual response, or wait more than 5 minutes between blocks, the experiment will terminate.
