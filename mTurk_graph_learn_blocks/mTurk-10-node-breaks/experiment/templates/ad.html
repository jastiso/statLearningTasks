	The ad.html has a very specific format.
	
	Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.
	
	The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
	the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
	your hit.
	
	The second part of the ad display after the person selected
	"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
	ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
	open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
	server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).
	
	See comments throughout for hints

			<h1>Call for participants</h1>
			<p>
				The University of Pennsylvania is looking for online participants
				for a brief psychology experiment. The only requirements
				are that you are at least 18 years old and are a fluent English
				speaker. It is also <b>HIGHLY</b> recommended that you are using a QWERTY keyboard.
				The task will take approximately 30 minutes and will pay $10-$15.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this study, participants will press a series of keys on their keyboard in response to targets shown on the screen.
				The study will last approximately 90 minutes.
			</p>
			<p>
				This experiment will <b>NOT</b> work in a mobile browser.
			</p>
			{% else %}
			<script type="text/javascript">
				const accepted = true;
			</script>
			<!--
				OTHERWISE
				If assignmentid is NOT "ASSIGNMENT_ID_NOT_AVAILABLE"
				it means the participant has accepted your hit.
				You should thus show them instructions to begin the
				experiment ... usually a button to launch a new browser
				window pointed at your server.
				
				It is important you do not change the code for the
				openwindow() function below if you want you experiment
				to work.
			-->
			<h1>Thank you for accepting this HIT!</h1>
			<p>
				By clicking the following URL link, you will be taken to the experiment,
				including complete instructions and an informed consent agreement.
